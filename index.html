                                <p>You have more flexibility in making things happen. You pounce on opportunities the

                                <p>You are as concerned with how the organization performs and you double down on how we can
                                        become 10x. You are always thinking of the organization roadmap and execute what you
                                        think is best for the organization.</p>
                                <p>As the executive among the VPs, you are the manager. You are deeply concerned with each of

                                        the root of the matter whenever they do not perform well.</p>
                                <p>Your excellent work ethic, standards of quality, and can-do attitude takes the organization
                                        far more than it could be without you.</p>

            Looks matter, but so does what’s on the inside. Content Marketing
            works closely with Branding to produce original, engaging content
            for our online platforms. In their written pieces on UX and our own
            initiatives and projects, this department displays what UXSoc is all
            about.
