                                <p>As the executive among the VPs, you are the manager. You are deeply concerned with each of

                                <p>Your excellent work ethic, standards of quality, and can-do attitude takes the organization
                                        far more than it could be without you.</p>

            Focuses on maximizing the organization’s funds and cultivating

            under the finance department will get a chance to see the money
            aspect of what operates much like a design firm. Through a
            rotational program, officers will be guided on how to put together
            financial statements and budget proposals for UXSoc events, ideate
            and execute fundraising projects, as well as promote financial
            literacy in the org within the context of the design community among
            others. The aim of this department is not only to better serve the
            organization, but to be able to produce officers who come out of
            this experience a little more confident in turning any passion they
            may have into a career.
