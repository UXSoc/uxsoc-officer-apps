                                <p>The President is in charge of establishing the vision for the organization and making sure it
                                        can be translated to a portfolio of projects and events during his/her term.</p>
                                <p>He/she is also in charge of monitoring or handling external affairs of the organization. He
                                        or she should be open to mentoring the next set of leaders for the organization. </p>
                                <p>Some responsibilities/tasks include coordinating with LIONS and other offices, partnering up
                                        with companies and organizations for design-led initiatives, constantly absorbing
                                        lessons, tools, and methods that can help the organization with its projects, and
                                        ensuring that the EB is happy and growing.</p>
                                <p>It’s recommended that the President has the skills of effective communication, persuasion,
                                        ability to handle conflict, good judgment and past experience on leadership and team

                                <p>He/she fills in the gaps the President cannot fill. The EVP understands that the President
                                        cannot do it alone, and neither can the organization.</p>
                                <p>You have more flexibility in making things happen. You pounce on opportunities the
                                        organization can undertake fearlessly — whether it be through multimedia, partnerships,
                                        branding, potential events, and more.</p>
                                <p>You are as concerned with how the organization performs and you double down on how we can
                                        become 10x. You are always thinking of the organization roadmap and execute what you
                                        think is best for the organization.</p>
                                <p>As the executive among the VPs, you are the manager. You are deeply concerned with each of
                                        their growth. You schedule individual consultations, hold honest conversations, and find
                                        the root of the matter whenever they do not perform well.</p>
                                <p>Your excellent work ethic, standards of quality, and can-do attitude takes the organization
                                        far more than it could be without you.</p>
